Your Development Environment
============================


Text Editors
::::::::::::

Just about anything that can edit plain text will work for writing Python code,
however, using a more powerful editor may make your life a bit easier.


Vim
---

Vim is a text editor which uses keyboard shortcuts for editing instead of menus
or icons. There are a couple of plugins and settings for the Vim editor to
aid Python development. If you only develop in Python, a good start is to set
the default settings for indentation and line-wrapping to values compliant with
:pep:`8`. In your home directory, open a file called :file:`.vimrc` and add the
following lines::

    set textwidth=79  " lines longer than 79 columns will be broken
    set shiftwidth=4  " operation >> indents 4 columns; << unindents 4 columns
    set tabstop=4     " a hard TAB displays as 4 columns
    set expandtab     " insert spaces when hitting TABs
    set softtabstop=4 " insert/delete 4 spaces when hitting a TAB/BACKSPACE
    set shiftround    " round indent to multiple of 'shiftwidth'
    set autoindent    " align the new line indent with the previous line

With these settings, newlines are inserted after 79 characters and indentation
is set to 4 spaces per tab. If you also use Vim for other languages, there is a
handy plugin called indent_, which handles indentation settings for Python source
files.

There is also a handy syntax plugin called syntax_ featuring some improvements over
the syntax file included in Vim 6.1.

These plugins supply you with a basic environment for developing in Python.
To get the most out of Vim, you should continually check your code for syntax
errors and PEP8 compliance. Luckily PEP8_ and Pyflakes_ will do this for you.
If your Vim is compiled with :option:`+python` you can also utilize some very handy
plugins to do these checks from within the editor.

For PEP8 checking, install the vim-pep8_ plugin, and for pyflakes you can
install vim-pyflakes_. Now you can map the functions ``Pep8()`` or ``Pyflakes()``
to any hotkey or action you want in Vim. Both plugins will display errors at
the bottom of the screen, and provide an easy way to jump to the corresponding
line. It's very handy to call these functions whenever you save a file. In
order to do this, add the following lines to your :file:`.vimrc`::

    autocmd BufWritePost *.py call Pyflakes()
    autocmd BufWritePost *.py call Pep8()

If you are already using syntastic_, you can set it to run Pyflakes on write
and show errors and warnings in the quickfix window. An example configuration
to do that which also shows status and warning messages in the statusbar would be::

    set statusline+=%#warningmsg#
    set statusline+=%{SyntasticStatuslineFlag()}
    set statusline+=%*
    let g:syntastic_auto_loc_list=1
    let g:syntastic_loc_list_height=5


Python-mode
^^^^^^^^^^^

Python-mode_ is a complex solution for working with Python code in Vim.
It has:

- Asynchronous Python code checking (``pylint``, ``pyflakes``, ``pep8``, ``mccabe``) in any combination
- Code refactoring and autocompletion with Rope
- Fast Python folding
- Virtualenv support
- Search through Python documentation and run Python code
- Auto PEP8_ error fixes

And more.

SuperTab
^^^^^^^^

SuperTab_ is a small Vim plugin that makes code completion more convenient by
using ``<Tab>`` key or any other customized keys.

Interpreter Tools
:::::::::::::::::


virtualenv
----------

Virtualenv is a tool to keep the dependencies required by different projects
in separate places, by creating virtual Python environments for them.
It solves the "Project X depends on version 1.x but, Project Y needs 4.x"
dilemma, and keeps your global site-packages directory clean and manageable.

`virtualenv <http://www.virtualenv.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ creates
a folder which contains all the necessary executables to use the
packages that a Python project would need. An example workflow is given
below.

Install virtualenv:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install virtualenv


Create a virtual environment for a project:

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd my_project
    $ virtualenv venv

``virtualenv venv`` will create a folder in the current directory
which will contain the Python executable files, and a copy of the ``pip``
library which you can use to install other packages. The name of the
virtual environment (in this case, it was ``venv``) can be anything;
omitting the name will place the files in the current directory instead.

To start using the virtual environment, run:

.. code-block:: console

    $ source venv/bin/activate


The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left
of the prompt (e.g. ``(venv)Your-Computer:your_project UserName$``) to
let you know that it's active. From now on, any package that you install
using ``pip`` will be placed in the ``venv`` folder, isolated from the global
Python installation.

Install packages as usual:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install requests

To stop using an environment, simply type ``deactivate``. To remove the
environment, just remove the directory it was installed into. (In this
case, it would be ``rm -rf venv``.)

Other Notes
^^^^^^^^^^^

Running ``virtualenv`` with the option :option:`--no-site-packages` will not
include the packages that are installed globally. This can be useful
for keeping the package list clean in case it needs to be accessed later.
[This is the default behavior for ``virtualenv`` 1.7 and later.]

In order to keep your environment consistent, it's a good idea to "freeze"
the current state of the environment packages. To do this, run

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip freeze > requirements.txt

This will create a :file:`requirements.txt` file, which contains a simple
list of all the packages in the current environment, and their respective
versions. Later it will be easier for a different developer (or you, if you
need to re-create the environment) to install the same packages using the
same versions:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This can help ensure consistency across installations, across deployments,
and across developers.

Lastly, remember to exclude the virtual environment folder from source
control by adding it to the ignore list.

virtualenvwrapper
-----------------

`Virtualenvwrapper <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/virtualenvwrapper>`_ makes
virtualenv a pleasure to use by wrapping the command line API with a nicer CLI.

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install virtualenvwrapper


Put this into your :file:`~/.bash_profile` (Linux/Mac) file:

.. code-block:: console

    $ export VIRTUALENVWRAPPER_VIRTUALENV_ARGS='--no-site-packages'

This will prevent your virtualenvs from relying on your (global) site packages
directory, so that they are completely separate.
[Note: This is the default behavior for ``virtualenv`` 1.7 and later]
